GreyOS is a new kind of OS, a Meta-OS.

GreyOS introduces a new era of unlimited possibilities with the concept of Cloud Computer (CC). GreyOS is still under rigorous development 
and not a final system to be deployed for business purposes. Ths CC is the next generation of computing but highly experimental for now.
GreyOS is based on the latest [micro-MVC](https://github.com/g0d/micro-MVC) and supported by various developers across the globe.

For a detailed introduction to GreyOS please check the [Introductory Document](https://github.com/g0d/GreyOS/blob/master/Documents/GreyOS%20-%20Introductory%20Document.pdf) or alternatively check the [White Paper](https://github.com/g0d/GreyOS/blob/master/Documents/GreyOS%20-%20Era%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Computer%20(White%20Paper).pdf) and the [Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g0d/GreyOS/master/Misc/GreyOS%20-%20Cloud%20Architecture.png).

Also, you may give it a try at https://greyos.gr/ (Credentials: demo@greyos.gr / password)

Finally, you can try booting GreyOS directly from a device with the [Meta-USB ISO](https://mega.nz/file/8iIBXJTb#tnYs7NzaPT8vDcP9KN5lPgEiMyi0BHhROXiZT3fDgL8). In order to do so, you have to burn the ISO image in a USB that is at least 32GiB or more, using Rufus.
